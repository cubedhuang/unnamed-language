# Test

[Home](/)

This is currently a proof-of-concept page using Markdown combined with Typst and a custom rehype plugin for linguistic interlinear glossing. Below is an example of a block expression with Typst.

$$
lambda x.lambda y.y(x)
$$

This is some more text. Oh right. $"typst"$ also works inline, so I can write facts like $e^(i tau) = 0$. Below is an example of an interlinear gloss. I use a special `gloss` directive block.

:::gloss
| Toki Pona
jan li pana e moku tawa sina
= person :sc[ind] give :sc[acc] food :sc[dat] you
| 'A person gives you food.'
:::

The syntax for an interlinear gloss is as follows:

```md
:::gloss
| Chinese
你 写 书
/ ní xiě **shū**
= :sc[2SG] write **book**
| 'You write a **book**.'
:::
```

:::gloss
| Chinese
你 写 书
/ ní xiě **shū**
= :sc[2SG] write **book**
| 'You write a **book**.'
:::

I'm using `remark-directive` to delineate the block. It's very useful. I also have a separate plugin that takes the `sc` directive blocks and applies smallcaps to them.
