# Unnamed Language

## Introduction

The goal of this language is to make something that looks kind of like a loglang. Hopefully, this follows Hoemaı's definition of a logical language from his [blog post](https://toaqlanguage.wordpress.com/2022/09/26/logical-language-misconceptions/) on the topic.

By the time I'm done writing this, we should hopefully have an unambiguous translation from the following sentence to the following logical form.

:::gloss
ch ná soli vén fan
= like some creature every food
| 'Some animals like every food.'
| $$ "ASSERT"(lambda x: "animal"(x).x ... "something") $$
:::

## Phonology

### Consonants

All consonants but /ʔ/ may appear in a syllable onset.

| Consonants    | Labial | Alveolar | Retroflex | Velar | Glottal |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | --------- | ----- | ------- |
| **Nasal**     | m      | n        |           | ŋ     |         |
| **Plosive**   | p      | t        |           | k     | ʔ       |
| ^             | b      | d        |           | g     |         |
| **Affricate** |        | t͡s d͡z    | ʈ͡ʂ ɖ͡ʐ     |       |         |
| **Fricative** | f      | s        | ʂ         |       | h       |
| ^             | v      | z        | ʐ         |       |         |
| **Liquid**    |        |          |           |       |         |

The sounds /ʈ͡ʂ ɖ͡ʐ ʂ ʐ/ have allophones /t͡ʃ d͡ʒ ʃ ʒ/.
